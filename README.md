## Hi there! Welcome to my Github profile!! 👋
I am Atharva Atul Joshi, MSc Data Science Graduate. One of the best definitions of data science, came from my professor when I started my Data Science Journey. He said and I quote, Data Science is asking questions to the data! This has been my core value while working on any project, while doing any research. All the projects I do which you will see here on my Github keep that one question in mind. I am someone who prefers quality over quantity, purpose driven approach over trends driven approach, sustainability oriented projects over fleeting, hype-driven work.
